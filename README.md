# AttentionSeeker üëÄ üì∫

### A Python program that pauses the video you are watching if you are not looking at the screen! This is the perfect solution for if you want to respond to a text without missing any important scenes and without having to manually pause the video üòÅ 

To run the code from the terminal, clone the repo and run the following commands (assuming you‚Äôre beginning at the root of the repo):
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python3 seeker.py
- To quit, click on the video pop-up and press the "q" button or ctrl-c on your terminal






#### Important notes!
- You will need to give permissions to your terminal in order for the project to work as expected (both camera and mouse privalges)
- A good quality webcam is needed for this to work as expected, poor webcams make it hard for the program to be able to detect your eyes
- The closer you are to the camera, the better it works. This is perfect for watching videos on your laptop or at your desk
- Works optimally on people who are not wearing glasses
- This works both on fullscreen and windowed video settings
